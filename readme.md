The code for a website to showcase King's Host book by [Irinel-Ramona Florescu](https://www.behance.net/iflorescu).
The website was built with React and [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) by [Ionut-Cristian Florescu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icflorescu/) and is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The source-code repo is [github.com/kings-host-book/src](https://github.com/kings-host-book/src), the build process outputs the minified code in the main organization repo [github.com/kings-host-book/kings-host-book.github.io](https://github.com/kings-host-book/kings-host-book.github.io).

## Where can I read the book?

THE HOST is a fantasy book available at [kingshost.cc](https://kingshost.cc).

[Book One](https://kingshost.cc/book-one/) can be downloaded for free and the author is looking forward for your support to help her write [the 2nd book](https://kingshost.cc/book-two/).
